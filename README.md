## Introduction

*Logistic Regression*

A statistical model called logistic regression is used to predict a binary outcome based on one or more feature variables in classification issues. The model uses maximum likelihood estimation to learn weights from the training data and then estimates a sigmoid-shaped function that maps the feature values to a probability of belonging to each class. In machine learning and data science, logistic regression is a widely used technique for a number of purposes, such as credit risk assessment, fraud detection, spam filtering, and medical diagnosis.


## Dataset Overview

*Logistic 1*

The "Customer Satisfaction Survey at Kashmir cafe" dataset is a valuable collection of responses obtained from a customer satisfaction survey conducted at Cafe, a restaurant or food delivery service. The dataset serves as a comprehensive source of feedback, insights, and opinions gathered from customers regarding their experience with Garden's services.

*Logistic 2*

The training set should be used to build your machine learning models. For the training set, we provide the outcome (also known as the “ground truth”) for each passenger. Your model will be based on “features” like passengers’ gender and class. You can also use feature engineering to create new features.

The test set should be used to see how well your model performs on unseen data. For the test set, we do not provide the ground truth for each passenger. It is your job to predict these outcomes. For each passenger in the test set, use the model you trained to predict whether or not they survived the sinking of the Titanic.

We also include gender_submission.csv, a set of predictions that assume all and only female passengers survive, as an example of what a submission file should look like.

## Project Objectives

- Understand the logistic function's features and underlying principles: The logistic function is a mathematical function that serves as the foundation for logistic regression. To also appropriately interpret the outcomes of logistic regression, one must comprehend the characteristics of the logistic function, such as its curvature and form.

- Understanding the logistic regression model's mathematical formulation: The logistic regression model is a statistical model that explains how a set of features and a binary target variable are related.

- Understand how to read logistic regression coefficients: The coefficients that logistic regression estimates show how each feature affects the target variable's likelihood. Knowing how to analyze these coefficients can assist in determining which characteristics are less significant and which have the strongest correlation with the target variable.

- Learn how features/predictors relate to target classes: Given a collection of features or predictors, a model that estimates the likelihood of each target class is constructed using logistic regression. To use logistic regression efficiently, one must have a solid understanding of the link between these features and target classes.

## Result and Discussion

*Logistic 1: Customer Survey Satisfaction at Ali's

- Our independent variable is Was your order accurate? Please respond 1 or 0.
- Here we made the yes or no as binary to 1 or 0.
- The dependent variables are How satisfied were you with your overall delivery experience at Ali, How satisfied were you with the quality of the food at Alis, and How satisfied were you with the speed of delivery at Alis
